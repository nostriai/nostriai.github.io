Federated inference over relays (Fior) enables local training of AI models on users devices, without transmitting raw data to a central server. People keep full control over their data and gain from collective learning by exchanging trained models on a global nostri marketplace. Each exchange of locally trained models in nostri marketplace will contribute to the development of smarter, and more effective AI models.
